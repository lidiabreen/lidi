<p>My name is Lidia Breen. I am currently a sophomore at Lehigh University, double-majoring in Politicial Science and Journalism. I also play on the Women's Soccer Team! This website is a portfoilo of data vizualizations I have created in a seven-week Data Vizualization course at Lehigh. Check out some of the links below to see infographics, timelines, graphs, maps and other cool things!</p>

<p>Here are some of my projects that I worked on while in DataViz at Lehigh. </p>

<h1>
<a id="infographic" class="anchor" href="#infographic" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Infographic</h1>

<p>This infographic was created using Canva to represent census data regarding Lehigh University in an engaging, visual way. I looked at the increase/decrease of those enrolled in the Political Science program here at Lehigh over time. </p>

<h1>
<a id="chart" class="anchor" href="#chart" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Chart</h1>

<p>This was created using ChartBuilder, a program that allows you to input data, from which it creates a baseline, simple chart that you can edit from that point on to clearly represent your data. This particular chart shows the enrollment data for the three different schools through 10 years of Lehigh.</p>

<h1>
<a id="timeline" class="anchor" href="#timeline" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Timeline</h1>

<p>This timeline was created using TimelineJS, which allows you to embed images and information into a simple, easy to navigate timeline format in order to show the history of something. I chose to look at the history of Lehigh Women's Soccer, since I am a part of the team and it interests me to see what our history is.</p>

<h1>
<a id="google-fusion-maps" class="anchor" href="#google-fusion-maps" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Google Fusion Maps</h1>

<p>This program allows you to create an interactive map with cards that show different information when ever you click on an embedded location. I chose to illustrate the different breakfast options in the Lehigh area, for people who may wish to go somewhere other than the dining hall for a weekend breakfast.</p>
